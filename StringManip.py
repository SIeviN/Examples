#In the language of your choice, write a method that modifies a string using the following rules:
#1. Each word in the input string is replaced with the following: the first letter of the word, the count of distinct letters between the first and last letter, 
# and the last letter of the word. For example, â€œAutomotive parts" would be replaced by "A6e p3s".
#2. A "word" is defined as a sequence of alphabetic characters, delimited by any non-alphabetic characters.
#3. Any non-alphabetic character in the input string should appear in the output string in its original relative location.



#Write your code below.

#Assumptions: If a one letter word, print first character, then 0.
#             If a two letter word, print first character, then 0, then last character.
#             If a non-alpha character is in the middle of a word, it should be there in the output, no spaces separating it from the letters around it.

#Test cases
#1. Automotive parts                    = A6e p3s
#2. Gatorade                            = G5e
#3. A motive gear                       = A0 m4e g2r
#4. Race car!                           = r2e c1r!
#5. Franklin, Esq.                      = F6n, E1q.
#6. An iguana                           = A0n i4a
#7. Extr3mely d!fficu1t te$t            = E2r3m2y d0!f3u1t0 t0e$t0
